        <h3> a little about me </h3>
         <p>   
            I graduated from Old Dominion University in the Spring of 2019 with a B.S. in Structual Engineering.
            In the four years since I graduated, I have been working as a Naval Architect. My main job duties include risk assessment 
            and serving as a subject matter expert (SME) on ship structure and stability in order tackle technical problems while remaining within budget and on schedule. 
            One of the biggest skills needed for my job is critical thinking and problem solving and this has been proven useful
            in my journey of learning Python, Javascript, and other skills. 
            It has been an joyous experience conquering the cloud and its all of it capabilites!
        </p>
        <p>
        You can find a summary of my skills and certifications <a href="./skills.html">here</a> and see how 
            I put my them to use under the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
        <h3>Why am I making switch? </h3>
        <p>I have always been interested in a career in tech, even back when I was finishing up my undergrad degree. 
            It just didn't seem attainable. I began hearing about AWS and then Azure and decided to study for the AZ-900. I loved it!
            Then, I took the AZ-104 and was introduced to SQL which lead me to take the DP-900. I began to become more consistent with learning how to
            code and then took the AZ-204. I loved every bit of learning about the cloud and even plan to branch into learning AWS once I complete the AZ-305. 
            Now that I have built up my confidence and improved on my cloud development, I would love a position where I could put my new found knowledge to use.
