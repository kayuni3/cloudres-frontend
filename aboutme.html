        <h3 class="highlight2"> About Me </h3>
         <p class="certtext">   
           I am a highly analytical and detail-oriented Naval Architect with 
           extensive experience in engineering and implementing technical solutions for complex marine structures and systems and am 
           seeking a challenging role as an entry-level Solution Architect to leverage my technical expertise 
           and project management skills to design and implement innovative technology solutions for clients. <br>
     
 
           Since graduating from Old Dominion University in May of 2019 with my B.S. in Structual Engineering, I have been working as a Naval Architect. 
           My main job duties include performing stress and risk analysis assesement, project management
           and design technical solutions as a subject matter expert (SME) on ship structure and stability while remaining within budget and on schedule. 
           This experience has greatly sharpened my analytical skills (and surprisingly my verbal communication skills).
           <br>
           My growth mindset never allows me to simply know enough which led me to discovering the cloud. 
           It has been an joyous experience conquering the cloud and its all of it capabilites, and I would love a position where I could put my new found knowledge to use.
