        <h3> Introduction </h3>
         <p style= "font-size: 1.5em;">   
            My name is Kaija Wilson. I am a Microsoft Certified Azure Adminstrator and Power BI Data Analyst. 
             I graduated from Old Dominion University in the Spring of 2019 with a B.S. in Structual Engineering.
            In the four years since I graduated, I have been working as a Naval Architect. My main job duties include project management, problem solving,
            and serving as a subject matter expert (SME) on ship structure and stability in order tackle technical problems while remaining within budget and on schedule. 
            One of the biggest skills needed for my job is critical thinking and problem solving and this has been proven useful
            in my journey of learning Python, Javascript, SQL, and other skills. 
            It has been an joyous experience conquering the cloud and its all of it capabilites, and I would love a position where I could put my new found knowledge to use.
